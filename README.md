# Cosmic Weight Website
## This is a Django app that can display your weight and other data on any planet of your choosing.

### Description
**Overview:**<br>
This website allows the user to enter their weight, and then uses Solar System OpenData to retrieve various data about the planet
that is selected. Data includes aphelion, perihelion, name, and gravity.

**Technologies:**<br>
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and uses Django Ninja REST framework for the back-end. It uses Docker as well for publishing the website.

**Improvements:**<br>
This project can be built on further. We were originally going to create an orbital mapping of the planets with accurate positioning. Instead, the current presentation is in a vertical format.
